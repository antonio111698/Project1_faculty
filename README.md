 ReptilesAttack! - Unity 2D Game
 
 - I developed this project as part of my study on the Unity game engine. This
game is a 2D tower defense game.
- You have a character that can navigate through the map, and there are rows
of enemies that are attacking the tower. I learned C# working on this project,
and got a better understanding of how a layered application should look like.
Familiarised with event based programming, and worked on a small difficulty
system.
- During the game, enemies are starting to come in higher numbers, and, as
a plus, I developed a small algorithm that gave some strategies to the AI, so
enemies can come in compact groups, such that enemies that are in front
of the group will shield the others enemies by your attacks, or they can try to
circle you and damage you. This is based on how low is your HP level and
how big is your kill streak until getting hit a first time
